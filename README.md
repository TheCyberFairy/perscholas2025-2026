# Per Scholas Study Sessions 💻🛡️🔒

This repository follows my progress through my in person Per Scholas Information Technology bootcamp From Oct 2025 through Feb 2026. Each folder represents a course section or study session. Inside each folder are my notes (summarizing key concepts) and labs (hands-on practice).

## Goals 🎯

- Complete study sessions for the current program timeline
- Document notes and labs consistently
- Practice core tools daily
- Build a shareable portfolio before graduation

## Progress Tracking 📑

- [ ] Week 1 Intro and accounts set up
- [ ] Week 2 Core tools install and smoke test
- [ ] Week 3 First hands on lab
- [ ] Week 4 Networking and troubleshooting
- [ ] Week 5 Review and practice quiz

Add more days as needed. Check items when you finish them.
